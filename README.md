# CSE572-HW1-CGMDataAnalysis

The objective of the project is to implement data mining concepts on datasets about Type-1 Diabetes patients.

The dataset contains time-series for **Continous Glucose Monitoring** and **Insulin ingestion**(_Bolus_:external ingestion of large dosages during meals and _Basal_: internal ingestion of small dosage in small quantities).


Each patient has the following files:
1. CGMDatenumLunchPat#.csv - TimeSeries for CGM 
2. CGMSeriesLunchPat#.csv - Glucose levels by CGM 
3. InsulinDatenumLunchPat1.csv - TimeSeries for Insuline ingestion
4. InsulinBasalLunchPat#.csv - Basal ingestion quantity 
5. InsulinBolusLunchPat1.csv - Bolus ingestion quantity
